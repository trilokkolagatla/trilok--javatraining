# trilok-java-training
GIT HUB:
The place where we can build our own project,software and all web apps.As we know it is a open source and so based on repository to create a new directory under our name.I learnt about how create,push and import code from remote places through web.There are branches under which we can build our code and link of all them to master branch.We have SSH id created for my system.

JAVA:
It is platform independent programming language that can be compiled on any compiler like ECLIPSE,Net Beans and command prompt.
we covered the usage of all Operators,Data Types,methods,classes,objects and overview of javabasics along with programs on them.

package com.github.trilokkolagatla.project; - package Name

import - java.util.Scanner;used to import package

public class Decimal{ - creating class in package

	public int returnreverse(int n){ - method declaration
	
	int a -  Data Type
	
	Also there are many pre-defined and Build-in functions used in java.
	So this makes our work more simple and easy.
	
	
	J-UNIT Testing:
	It is used to test our units in the program based on RIGHT and BI-CEP which is use to determine whether the program is satisfied with all necessary conditions based on standards and fufill all the necessary requirements of the user.so now let us see in detail the explanation of all test case conditions.
	B - Boundary Conditions :Based on range
	
	I-Inverse Relation :Suppose i*i=16 and i=sqroot(16);
	
	C-Correction by Measure :Based on correct features
	
	E-Error Rate :Measure of failure
	
	P-Performance :Based on compilation time and run-time compilation.
	
	There are 3 main mottos of J-unit Testing :
	1.Intent - The main of aim of our code
	2.Isolation - The method is independent of the other method.
	3.Repeatability - Ease of access should be same for multiple times of run.
	
	@Test
public void hasPositiveBalance() {
account.deposit(50);
assertTrue(account.hasPositiveBalance());
}
The above thing is a sample code for j-unit testing of checking whether the bank account has balance or not in the account.

Based on all the concepts they are "CORRECT" conditions to be satisfied.In order to satisfy the needs of RIGHT to develop a proper J-Unit testing.
Let us define the features of CORRECT:

C-Conformance :For reaching the correct standards like-wise rules

O-Ordering :Follow the order to maintain ease

R-Range :The boundary conditions based on which the actual test is done.

R-Reference:The use of inheritance and abstract methods should be allowed.

E-Existence:To check whether the file have been created or present in class. 

C-cordially:For checking the use of web applications with multiple screens.

T-Time:Based on performance and efficiency

These are the factors or the requirements based on which j-unit testing is done in order to meet the demand of software created in the real world.


	Zipper Code:
	
	This is alphanumeric code based on which address is being uniquely identified with the help of geolocation (latitude and longtitude).
	Here,we generate zipper code based on random number generation and link that with the help of address taken from the user regarding
